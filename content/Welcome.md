The Workshop on **Computer Vision for Microscopy Image Analysis (CVMI)** will be held on **June 18, 2018** in conjunction with the [CVPR 2018](http://cvpr2018.thecvf.com) conference.

This workshop will bring together computer vision experts from academia, industry, and
government who have made progress in developing computer vision tools for microscopy
image analysis. It will provide a comprehensive forum on this topic and foster in-depth
discussion of technical and application issues. It will also serve as an introduction to
researchers and students curious about this important and fertile field.
